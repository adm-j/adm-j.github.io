Garden Vets is a veterinary practice run as a service, using a subscription modal to access their services. The web app
we built is used for users to sign up, taking in information on pets and the owner, as well as offering the ability to
subscribe, of which the subscription is calculated based on the information provided. I contributed to front end and
back end functionality, as well as deployment and bridging between other third party services.
