Sunbelt City is a project to create an interactive visualisation, allowing users to explore and see
the various things Sunbelt Rentals works on as well as point them to their website for further information. 
This complex project involved creating a system to render the graphics seen below, allow for multiple scenes 
and web elements for menus to view information and link to their main website. I put in alot of work into the 
mobile UI components and changes to the system to improve performance and streamline the workflow, allowing
us to increase productivity.

Building on the interest generated by this project, I’ve also begun developing a new iteration—a custom rendering engine 
designed to streamline the creation of similar work for future clients. As the lead architect, I’m responsible for 
making and implementing the key design decisions to achieve this.
