ViPER refers to a VR app for assisting in training and coaching soccer players. It started as a series of exercises
done within VR for collecting data on things such as head tracking, which are then viewable within a web portal with
the ability to compare and analyse performance. Later this would go on to include ViPER Coach, a variant that allows
for interactive multiplayer sessions between a coach and players in VR, allowing for coaching within a VR environment.
Included is the ability to upload matches using Opta data, allowing for playback on the interactive board or in VR to
replay moments from a game.

My contribution was building the web portal, alongside most of the backend functionality.
