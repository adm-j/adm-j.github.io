In the summer I spent some time trying to learn how game development works. As a big fan of the original Pokémon games,
I set out to try and recreate various mechanics for the games. These games use a grid based movement system, with
tilemaps to determine collision. I also needed to figure out how to perform scene transitions, handle NPCs movement,
collision and interactions. Battles were going to be implemented, but I wanted to move onto other things and it was
mainly UI work, so I decided to leave it here.
