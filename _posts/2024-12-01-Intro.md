Welcome to my website! I created this site to share the projects I’m working on, whether professionally or in my personal
time. Over time, I’ll likely add blog-style posts about interesting tech topics I come across.

In the future, I may also write tutorials on topics that I feel are not well-explained elsewhere. These will likely focus
on programming or Linux-related subjects, both of which I’m passionate about.
