Hello! I am a software developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, from full-stack web development to 
Unity. However, I consider myself a problem solver first and foremost. Curious by nature, I enjoy tinkering with various 
technologies and am especially fascinated by how things work at a lower level.

In my spare time, I am an avid video game enthusiast, though I also enjoy the occasional drink or scenic route. I am 
also passionate about learning new things, particularly in the tech space, and dedicate much of my time to this pursuit.

On this site, you’ll find some of the projects I’ve worked on both professionally and personally, as well as posts about
topics I’ve been exploring. I don’t expect to update too regularly, as my posts will likely accompany something I’ve 
been building or working on, and that often takes time!
