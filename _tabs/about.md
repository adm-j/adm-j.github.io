Hello! I am a software developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, from full-stack web development to 
Unity. However, I consider myself a problem solver first and foremost. Curious by nature, I enjoy tinkering with various 
technologies and am especially fascinated by how things work at a lower level.

In my spare time, I am an avid video game enthusiast, though I am quite a social person and enjoy the occasional drink 
or trip outdoors. I am also passionate about learning new things, particularly in the tech space, and dedicate much of 
my time to this pursuit.

On this site, you’ll find some of the projects I’ve worked on both professionally and personally, as well as posts about
topics I’ve been exploring. These posts will likely be in the form of tutorials or about side projects I've been working
on, so the frequency of these may vary!
